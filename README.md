# How To Learn To Code
I just want to share my own journey on how I learned to code.
Others did the same thing, but every story is unique.

## Interest In Video Games
I was not really exposed to computers when I was a child but
I was exposed and addicted to PlayStation games 
and Mortal Kombat, just to name a few. 

And since I
do not have any idea that these things were just being
developed, I just said to myself, computers are really great
for they (the computers alone) can create a bunch of great games.
And to my surprise, that was false.

## My First Computer Exposure
I was only exposed to computers when I was in college! Imagine!
And it was actually required for our courses. At first I was
so afraid, because that's a new thing to be learned and
my Facebook account was even made by my friend.

Then, I was provided by my mother a new laptop, an HP Pavilion netbook.
I explored everything. And the first time I was able to connect 
to the Internet and load a page, I was so amazed! But, it did not stay
that way. My mother could not continue paying the installment of
that netbook and I just went from time to time in several computer
shops just to accomplish things. So, I was exposed to several versions
of the Windows OS.

## My Course Was Not Even Related To Computer
My college course was not IT-related or even Com Scie! But,
during those times, there were several others who were really interested
in computers, like installation, hardware setup and aspiring software
developers who wanted to take that course in another university. And all
I was doing was just listening to them! And by that, I learned things.

## Coding Exposure
There was this general course in computer and one lesson was about MS Excel,
how to create simple formulas (particularly the IF formula). 
When I saw the demonstration of the instructor,
my mind wandered to things a computer can do! And I promised to myself, I would create
one someday.

And that was really accomplished years later when I was working as a teacher.

## How I Taught Myself To Code
Even for the other skills, like playing a guitar, I taught myself just by
watching online tutorials. So, that's not really teaching yourself a new skill
from scratch, it's teaching yourself how to learn.

In the case of computer programming, I started learning
PureBasic. Prior to this, I successfully created an MS Excel program, a flat
file database. It was really a good project that no one attempted or even
realized to solve a particular problem.

If you are really determined to learn new things, then you will definitely learn that.
That's the most important one.

But it was a rough start. I could not even understand the things in PureBasic tutorial!
Even if I already had some knowledge about formulas in MS Excel, that was really
tough! As if you read things without comprehension!

But remember, if you are really that determined you should never give up!

After that, I recommend understanding these things

During those times, when I was working in a big company, my companion
was just this computer. So, I had the chance to explore everything.
And that was pretty much it.

## The Truth About Programming
The reason why we do computer programming is to instruct the computer
exactly the things we want the computer to do for us. But it comes with a price.
The computer can only understand the machine language but using pure
machine language for the programmer is a very cumbersome task.

Hence, the computer and the programmer must meet halfway, that's is where
computer programming languages comes in. Assembly Language was next to Machine Language,
it is really good and even today, there are certain programs that should be written in Assembly.
But, just like the Machine Language, it's very cumbersome even for simple commands. So,
you as the programmer is quite limited by this.

Next to that, we have several programming languages that is expressed not as symbols but
much like a human language and one of the most significant is the C language. During
this time, the things we wanted to achieve were ambitious, so they never stop finding ways
and C was even upgraded to be used as the tool creating Desktop apps and games, 
that was C++.

Yet, we did not stay that way. We wanted more. The birth of the Web demanded another tool
that would be good in computer networking and creating web pages. Java simply had that 
opportunity. It became the current programming language during that time and scripting languages
like PHP (for backend) and JavaScript (for frontend) were emerging to output a web page.

Then, we could simply stay this way, yet we wanted more. Nowadays, creating web pages,
even dynamic ones were simplified by several frameworks and ready-made projects that sometimes
you don't even need to write a single line of code! Software development
is becoming more and more automatic!

But, in reality, the current trend is towards machine learning, where a certain program
learns by itself without directly coding it to behave that way!

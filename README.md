# How To Learn To Code
I just want to share my own journey on how I learned to code.
Others did the same thing, but every story is unique.

## Interest In Video Games
I was not really exposed to computers when I was a child but
I was exposed to playstations and video games. And since I
do not have any idea that these things were just being
develop, I just said to myself, computers are really great
for they (the computers alone) can create a bunch of great games.
And to my surprise, that was false.

## My First Computer Exposure
I was only exposed to computers when I was in college! Imagine!
And it was actually required for our courses. At first I was
so afraid, because that's a new thing to be learned and
my Facebook account was even made by my friend.

Then, I was provided by my mother a new laptop, an HP Pavilion netbook.
I explored everything. And the first time I was able to connect 
to the Internet and load a page, I was so amazed! But, it did not stay
that way. My mother could not continue paying the installment of
that netbook and I just went from time to time in several computer
shops just to accomplish things.

## My Course Was Not Even Related To Computers
My college course was not IT-related or even Com Scie! But,
during those times, there were several others who were really interested
in computers, like installation, hardware setup and aspiring software
developers who wanted to take that course in another university. And all
I was doing was just listening to them! And by that, I learned things.

## Coding Exposure
There was this general course in computer and one lesson was about Excel,
how to create simple formulas. When I saw the demonstration of the instructor,
my mind wander to things a computer can do! And I promised to myself, I would create
one someday.

And that was really accomplished years later when I was working as a teacher.
